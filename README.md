## Overview
> Contrastive learning has achieved remarkable success on various high-level tasks, but there are fewer contrastive learning-based methods proposed for low-level tasks. It is challenging to adopt vanilla contrastive learning technologies proposed for high-level visual tasks to low-level image restoration problems straightly. Because the acquired high-level global visual representations are insufficient for low-level tasks requiring rich texture and context information. In this paper, we investigate the contrastive learning-based single image super-resolution from two perspectives: positive and negative sample construction and feature embedding. The existing methods take naive sample construction approaches (e.g., considering the low-quality input as a negative sample and the ground truth as a positive sample) and adopt a prior model (e.g., pre-trained VGG model) to obtain the feature embedding. To this end, we propose a practical contrastive learning framework for SISR, named PCL-SR. We involve the generation of many informative positive and hard negative samples in frequency space. Instead of utilizing an additional pre-trained network, we design a simple but effective embedding network inherited from the discriminator network which is more task-friendly. Compared with existing benchmark methods, we re-train them by our proposed PCL-SR framework and achieve superior performance. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show the effectiveness and technical contributions of our proposed PCL-SR thorough ablation studies.

## Train
### Prepare training data 

Download DIV2K training data (800 training + 100 validtion images).
For more informaiton, please refer to [EDSR(PyTorch)](https://github.com/thstkdgus35/EDSR-PyTorch) and [RCAN](https://github.com/yulunzhang/RCAN). 


### Begin to train

We adopt their official implementations in [EDSR(PyTorch)](https://github.com/thstkdgus35/EDSR-PyTorch), [RCAN](https://github.com/yulunzhang/RCAN) and [HAN](https://github.com/wwlCape/HAN).

Our contrastive loss with a GAN-like framework is implemented in [src/loss/adversarial.py](https://github.com/Aitical/PCL-SISR/src/loss/adversarial.py) and VGG-based contrastive loss is in [src/loss/cl.py](https://github.com/Aitical/PCL-SISR/src/loss/cl.py).

To reproduce our results, please take our code to their official implementations and re-train.

More methods and other low-level tasks will be tested in the future.

## Test

Test datasets can be found in [EDSR(PyTorch)](https://github.com/thstkdgus35/EDSR-PyTorch). PSNR and SSIM metric scripts can be found in [here](https://github.com/greatlog/DAN/tree/master/metrics).
